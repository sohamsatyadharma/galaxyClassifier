# Galaxy classfier 

This is a project to classify galaxies into the following three types using Galaxy Zoo data
1. Spiral 
2. Elliptical 
3. Merger

The classification was done using 
1. Decision tree with ~80% accuracy
2. Random forest classifier with ~87% accuracy

The features used were color indices, eccentricity, adaptive moments and concentration. Concentration was taken as the ratio of the radii containing 50% and 90% of the Petrosian flux.
